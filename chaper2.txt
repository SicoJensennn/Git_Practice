The only completely stationary object in the room was an
enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up
as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white,
and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had
just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I
must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and
snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.
Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the
curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned
slowly to the floor.
